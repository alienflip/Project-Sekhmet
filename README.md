We have an array of data: it represents the location of a pixel with some other data attached:

Each pixel therefore has a position `(x, y)`.

Additionally, we have a `velocity attached to each data-point`. This represents whether or not the pixel will `transfer state` to another pixel in it's vicinity.

This means that an array of `4x4` pixels looks like:

(....)(....)(....)(....)

(....)(....)(....)(....)

(....)(....)(....)(....)

(....)(....)(....)(....)

In the program.

And so each row of an array actually represents `rowWidth / 4` pixels, in reality, since the we will be working `modulo 4` as pixels need `4` data points to represent themselves.

Using openCL, we can take advantage of massive parrellelism in order to do boid calculations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) on local pixels, and then use global space to keep track of the averagees of the whole group.
